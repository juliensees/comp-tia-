Malware - malicious software that steals info, damages data, or disrupts normal use of the system
  -  Propogation Mechanism - how the malware spreads from one system to another
  -  Payload - the malicious action the malware performs
    
      - Spyware - gathers info without the users knowledge and reports it back
            - logging keystrokes, monitoring web browing, hd search, screen capture malware
      - Bloatware - unwanted software that comes pre-installed on a device that isn't needed & slows down resources
          - increases the attack surface (more software means more potentinal vulnerabilities)
      - Ransomware - blocks a legitimate user access to data
          - encrypts files with secret key and demanding ransom
      - Crypto-malware - form of malware that takes over the computing capacity of a user's sytem to mine crypto
      - Virus - something spread by any human action
          - good defense is user education
      - Worm - spreads by themselves without human interaction
          - best defense is to keep systems updated with most recent OS and app patches
              - RTM Worm - the first worm (1988), affected 10% of the internet 
      - Trojan Horse
          - pretends to be legitimate software, and then unleashes hidden software
            - best defense is app control
        - RAT - Remote Access Trojan - provide backdoors to remotely access systems
      - Backdoor - when a programmer provides a means to grant FUTURE access
          - hardcoded accounts (username/password) that always grant access to a system
          - default passwords that users might not remember/know to change (could just be admin)
          - unknown access channels to gain access to a system without going through normal authentication
      - Logic Bomb - malware that delivers a triggered payload when certain conditions are met
            - at a specific date/time
            - the modification of the contents of a file (file deletion, login event, etc)
            - API Call (an app requests info from an outside service)

     - Rootkits - type of malware that are designed for privilege escalation
           - hacker uses a rootkit to gain access to the root account (unrestricted super user access)
           - can deliver a variety of payloads (backdoors, botnet agents, adware, & spyware)
               - could be antitheft mechanism for copyrighted content
     - Filesless viruses - malware that remains in the memory (instead of writing into data) 
         - often execute as javascript code that's downloaded from a website
         - CANNOT BE FOUND WITH ANTIVIRUS SCANNING (NO MALICIOUS FILE!)
         - uses legitimate system tools (Powershell, WMI - Windows Management System)
      
      - Botnets - a collection (network) of zombie computers used for malicious purposes
            - a hacker creates a botnet by infecting computers with malware
                - hackers who create botnets usually sell or rent it to others
            - to deliver spam, engage in DDOS attacks, mine crypto, or brute force attacks against passwords
              - use indirect command & control network relay orders to hide botnet operator's true location
                - C&C mechanisms include: internet relay chat (IRC channels),twitter accounts,& peer to peer comm

### A script is a sequence of instructions written in a programming language to automate work    

    - Malicious script execution - hackers can write scripts that create back doors !!
      - Shell scripts - designed to be run at the command line & integrated with the operating system
      - Application scripts - integrated into software to allow interaction 
      - Programming languages - allow the creation of general purpose code 

      - Bash - a scripting language used on linux and mac systems 
      - Powershell - used on Windows systems to automate routine tasks
      - Macros - run within an app environment, allowing automation of tasks within an app
        - Visual Basic (VBA) - most common macro scripting language used by Microsoft Office 
      - Python - general purpose scripting language that can write code to perform any task
      
### TOP DEFENSE AGAINST MALWARE: ANTI-MALWARE SOFTWARE, SECURITY PATCHES, USER EDUCATION

### TCP/IP Model (actually used) collapeses the OSI Model (conceptual model) into fewer layers

    OSI Model - 7 layers 
    - "Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away"
      - 1 - Physical Layer
      - 2 - Data Link
      - 3 - Network
      - 4 - Transport
      - 5 - Session
      - 6 - Presentation
      - 7 - Application

    TCP/IP Model - 4 layers
      - 1 - Network Access (Covers layers 1 & 2
      - 2 - Internet (Covers layer 3)
      - 3 - Transport (Covers layer 4)
      - 4 - Application (Covers layer 5, 6, & 7)
