Vulnerabilities impact the CIA triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability of info

 - Confidentiality - ensures that only authorized indivuduals have access to info and resources
   
  -Disclosure attacks - seek to undermine confidentiality (attacks that result in unauthorized access to sensitive info)  
    - Data Breach - when sensitive data is successfully accessed or exfiltrated by an unauthorized party (only has to be viewed          to be a breach)    
    - Data exfiltration - the act of removing sensitive data outside of an org  
      - Methods used to carry out a disclosure attack  
        - Sniffing - 
        - MITM (Man in the Middle) - 
        - Phishing - 

  - Integrity - no unauthorized changes to an org's information
        - a hacker could intentionally alter info, or a service disruption affecting data stored in a system

  - Availability - ensures that info and systems are available for authorized users when needed
      - Denial of service attacks - seek to overwhelm a system and crash it (denying access)
   
  - Financial risk - monetary damage to the org
  - Reputational risk - negative publicity to customers/employees/etc.
  - Strategic risk - the risk an org will become less effective in meeting its goals/objectives
      - new info/product is lost (no other copy)
      - competitor gains hold of plans, and bring a competing product to market
  - Operational risk - the org's ability to carry out day to day functions
      - slow down business, delay delivery, etc.
  - Compliance Risk - when a security breach causes an org to run afoul of legal or regulatory 
      - running afoul of HIPAA (lost patient medical records in a breach) 

### Supply Chain Vulnerabilities

  - End-of-life announcements: announcing they will no longer provide patches for a product, even when vulnerabilities discovered
     - Step 1: end of sale - the vendor will not offer it for sale, but will continue supporting customers
     - Step 2: end of support - vendor provides a date when they will discontinue some/or all level of support
     - Step 3: end of life - the vendor no longer supports it at all, and will not release any updates, even for critical stuff
   
 ### Configuration vulnerabilities

  - common mistake is IT staff taking a system directly from a manufacturer without modifying the default config
     - default configs from copiers, building controllers, research equipment, etc can contain:
        - misconfigured firewalls with open ports/services
        - open permissions
        - guest accounts
        - default passwords
        - unsecured route accounts
     - cryptographic protocols
           - if an admin configures weak cipher suites
           - weak protocol implementations on a device (subject to eavesdropping)
           - poor key management
           - poor certificate management
     - Patch management of operating systems, apps, and firmware
     - Account management - make sure all accounts are configured correctly and no one has excess permissions
           - to prevent accidental or intentional misuse/damage

### Principle of Least Privilege - a user should only have the minimum necessary set of permissions required to perform job

Architecural Vulnerabilities - arise when a complex system is improperly designed (may create fundamental flaws)

IT Architecture - a set of well-defined practices and processes used to build complex systems
  - incorporate security requirements early (avoid add-on!)

System sprawl - new devices are connected to a network, but old ones are not promptly disconnected, leading to vulnerabilities 
   - even more serious when assets are undocumented

### ALWAYS AVOID LEGACY HARDWARE AND FIRMWARE
