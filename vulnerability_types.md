Vulnerabilities impact the CIA triad: confidentiality, integrity, and availability of info

 - Confidentiality - ensures that only authorized indivuduals have access to info and resources
   
  -Disclosure attacks - seek to undermine confidentiality (attacks that result in unauthorized access to sensitive info)  
    - Data Breach - when sensitive data is successfully accessed or exfiltrated by an unauthorized party (only has to be viewed to be a breach)  
    - Data exfiltration - the act of removing sensitive data outside of an org  
      - Methods used to carry out a disclosure attack  
        - Sniffing - 
        - MITM (Man in the Middle) - 
        - Phishing - 

  - Integrity - no unauthorized changes to an org's information
        - a hacker could intentionally alter info, or a service disruption affecting data stored in a system

  - Availability - ensures that info and systems are available for authorized users when needed
      - Denial of service attacks - seek to overwhelm a system and crash it (denying access)
   
  - Financial risk - monetary damage to the org
  - Reputational risk - negative publicity to customers/employees/etc.
  - Strategic risk - the risk an org will become less effective in meeting its goals/objectives
      - new info/product is lost (no other copy)
      - competitor gains hold of plans, and bring a competing product to market
  - Operational risk - the org's ability to carry out day to day functions
      - slow down business, delay delivery, etc.
  - Compliance Risk - when a security breach causes an org to run afoul of legal or regulatory 
      - running afoul of HIPAA (lost patient medical records in a breach)
