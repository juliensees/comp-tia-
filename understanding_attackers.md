Internal attackers - may pose greater risk because of their level of legitimate access
    - current/former employees/contractors may exploit their privilege
    - 51% of orgs experienced a security breach suffered an insider attack
    - 67% of insider breaches were more costly than external
    
  - Privilege Escalation Attacks - take a normal user's credentials and transform them to administrator accounts
  - Shadow IT - a technology brought into the org by individual employees without approval

Script Kitties - ususally lone individuals who are seeing if they can break into something, but usually lack             technical skills to develop their own exploits and just run scripts by other better hackers

APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) - highly sophisticated, well resourced attackers who gain access to a network         and stay there undetected for a long time to continously steal data or spy (rather than immediate damage)
    - usually nation-state sponsored 

White hats - hackers who operate with permission and good intent 
Grey hats - will break into a system (without permission) to find a vulnerability, but will then report it, or fix         for a fee

Data exfiltration - attackers attempt to target sensitive info that can be of high value
    - IP (intellectual property), customer/employee data, financial records, or conducting espionage

Service distruption - impedes the normal operation of sytems
    - may launch DOS attacks or ransomware to cripple a system

Attack Vectors - the path/method an attacker uses to gain unauthorized access 
  - Phishing e-mail - tricking someone in clicking a malicious link/attachment
  - Unpatched software - exploiting a known vulnerability in outdated software
  - Weak passwords - brute forcing or guessing credentials
  - Physical access - someone walking into a building and plugging in a malicious USB
  - Wireless networks - attacking through usnecured wifi
  - Web applicatins - exploiting vulnerabilities in websites like SQL injection
  - Supply Chain - compromising a third party vendor to get to the real target

Attack Surface - the total sum of all possible attack vectors on a system (all ways they could get in)
  - TO REDUCE RISK: disable unused ports, remove bloatware, patch software, enforce strong passwords

Zero-day Vulnerability - a vulnerability in a product that has been discovered by at least one researcher but       has not yet been patched by the vendor

Window of Vulnerability-the time between someone discovering a new vulnerability and the vendor releasing patch
